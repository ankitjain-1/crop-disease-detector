					<h4><b> Treatment : </b> </h4>
                    <h6>
                        Tomatoes that have early blight require immediate attention before the disease takes over the plants. Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic..</br></br>
                    </h6>    <h6>

					There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. As a result, every effort should be made to prevent the disease from entering your garden.
					<br>
1.Fungicides will NOT treat this viral disease.
<br>
2.Plant resistant varieties when available or purchase transplants from a reputable source.
<br>
3.Do NOT save seed from infected crops.
<br>
4.Spot treat with least-toxic, natural pest control products, such as Safer Soap, Bon-Neem and diatomaceous earth, to reduce the number of disease carrying insects.
<br>
5.Harvest-GuardÂ® row cover will help keep insect pests off vulnerable crops/ transplants and should be installed until bloom.
<br>
6.Remove all perennial weeds, using least-toxic herbicides, within 100 yards of your garden plot.
<br>
7.The virus can be spread through human activity, tools and equipment. Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination.
<br>
8.Avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet).
<br>
9.Avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants. Cigarettes and other tobacco products may be infected and can spread the virus.
<br>
10.Remove and destroy all infected plants (see Fall Garden Cleanup). Do NOT compost.
